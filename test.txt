Checking to see if my name updates.
It worked!!
I am adding text here, so it needs to be updated.
I am still struggling to get this to update on github.
So it doesn't let me commit. I keeps telling me "nothing to commit" Your branch is up to date.
But the txt file doesn't update. The text I type here isn't in the file on github.

It worked! You have to save FIRST, then do the commit. :)
